NormalyzerDE is a software designed to ease the process of selecting an optimal normalization approach for your dataset and to perform subsequent differential expression analysis.

Two features of particular importance:

* Retention time-segmented normalization approaches. These allow the normalization approach to counter bias induced by time-dependent fluctuations in the electrospray intensity.
* Empirical bayes-based statistics using the Limma package. This has been shown to be more sensitive in detection of differentially expressed features compared to ANOVA.
