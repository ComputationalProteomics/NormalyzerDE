Title: Evaluation of normalization methods and calculation of differential expression analysis statistics

Description: NormalyzerDE provides screening of normalization methods for 
    LC-MS based expression data. It calculates a range of normalized matrices 
    using both existing approaches and a novel time-segmented approach, 
    calculates performance measures and generates an evaluation report. 
    Furthermore, it provides an easy utility for Limma- or ANOVA- based 
    differential expression analysis.
