abstract: >
    When working with omics data you will encounter technical biases. These can often in part be remedied by using appropriate normalization approach. Normalyzer helps this process by both performing a number of readibly available normalizations as well as generating a summary document of the results.

## Input format

NormalyzerDE expects a raw data file. Columns can contain annotation information or sample data.
Each column should start with a header.

```
pepseq  s1      s2      s3      s4
ATAAGG  20.0    21.2    19.4    18.5
AWAG    23.3    24.1    23.5    17.3
ACATGM  22.1    22.3    22.5    23.2
```

This data should be provided with a design matrix where all data samples should be represented.
One column (default header "sample") should match the columns containing samples in the raw data.
Another column (default header "group") should contain condition levels which could be used for group-based
evaluations.

```
sample  group
s1      condA
s2      condA
s3      condB
s4      condB
```

## Running NormalyzerDE evaluation

The evaluation step can be performed with one command, `normalyzer`.
This command expects a path to the data file, a name for the run-job,
a path to a design matrix and finally a path to an output directory.

```{r}
library(NormalyzerDE)
normalyzer("data.tsv", "vignette_run", designMatrix="design.tsv", outputDir="testout")
```

## Running NormalyzerDE statistical comparisons

When you after performing the evaluation and having evaluated the report have decided
for which normalization approach seems to work best you can continue to the statistical step.

Here, expected parameters are the path to the target normalization matrix, the sample design matrix as
in the previous step, a job name, the path to an output directory and a list of the pairwise comparisons
for which you want to calculate contrasts. They are provided as a character vector with conditions to
compare separated by a dash ("-").

```{r}
normalyzerDE("testout/vignette_run/Loess-G-normalized.txt", "design.tsv", "vignette_run", 
             outputDir="testoutstat", comparisons=c("1-2", "1-3", "1-4"))
```

<!-- ## Evaluating results -->

<!-- This will generate a PDF containing  -->

<!-- ### Detecting outliers -->

<!-- The total intensity barplot can be used to see whether any samples has unusually high or low total intensity. -->

<!-- ![Total intensity](figs/1_tot_intensity.png) -->

<!-- The total missing can show if any sample has an unusual number of missing values, which can indicate an outlier. -->

<!-- ![Total NA](figs/2_tot_na.png) -->

<!-- The MDS plot gives an indication of how samples seems to group overall. We expect replicates to cluster closely - in particular for technical replicates. If one or a few samples are far of here it might indicate outliers. -->

<!-- ![MDS plot](figs/3_mds.png) -->

<!-- ### Variance investigations -->

<!-- After normalization intragroup variance is expected to be reduced within the group. This gives an assessment of how much the different normalizations influence the data, and sometimes which seems to perform the strongest. -->

<!-- ![Intragroup variance](figs/4_variance.png) -->

<!-- Normalization usually reduces variance measures compared to when doing a simple log2 transform. Similarly to the previous plot this gives an indication of how normalization influenced the variance in the data. -->

<!-- ![Variance compared to log2](figs/5_comp_variance.png) -->

<!-- The stable variables plot looks into features identified as particularly stable and checks how different normalization approaches influence their intragroup and overall variance.  -->

<!-- ![Stable variables](figs/6_stable_var.png) -->

<!-- ### Normalization comparisons -->

<!-- The scatter plot shows a distribution of CV over raw intensity for different normalization approaches (?). -->

<!-- ![Scatter](figs/7_scatter.png) -->

<!-- The MA plots shows the fold between the two first samples retrieved from the data matrix. Often in non-normalized there is a fold shift between samples which can be countered by normalization. Ideally the red fitting-line will go close to zero here. -->

<!-- ![MA plot](figs/8_ma.png) -->

<!-- The scatter plot plots intensities of sample 1 against sample 2. This gives a sense of how the intensities varies between samples. There will always be a variation, but overall they are expected to be close to a linear trend, with similar variation around independent of intensity. -->

# Retention time normalization

Retention time based normalization can be performed with an arbitrary normalization matrix.

## Basic usage

There are two points of access for the higher order normalization. Either by calling `getRTNormalizedMatrix` which applies the target normalization approach stepwise over the matrix based on retention times, or by calling `getSmoothedRTNormalizedMatrix` which generates multiple layered matrices and combines them. To use them you need your raw data loaded into a matrix, a list containing retention times and a normalization matrix able to take a raw matrix and return a normalized in similar format.

```{r}
fullDf <- read.csv("data.tsv", sep="\t")
designDf <- read.csv("design.tsv", sep="\t")
head(fullDf, 1)
head(designDf, 1)
```

At this point we have loaded the full data into dataframes. Next, we use the sample names present in the design matrix to extract sample columns from the raw data. Be careful that the sample names is a character vector. If it is a factor it will extract wrong columns.

Make sure that sample names extracted from design matrix are in right format. We expect it to be in 'character' format.

```{r}
sampleNames <- as.character(designDf$sample)
typeof(sampleNames)
```

Now we are ready to extract the data matrix from the full matrix. We also need to get the retention time column from the full matrix.

```{r}
dataMat <- as.matrix(fullDf[, sampleNames])
retentionTimes <- fullDf$Average.RT

head(dataMat, 1)
```

If everything is fine the data matrix should be `double`, and have the same number of rows as the number of retention time values we have.

```{r}
typeof(dataMat)

print("Rows and columns of data")
dim(dataMat)

print("Number of retention times")
length(retentionTimes)
```

The normalization function is expected to take a raw intensity matrix (?) and return log transformed values. We borrow the function for Loess normalization from NormalyzerDE. As long as it follow the same input/output format it could be replaced with a custom function.

```{r}
performCyclicLoessNormalization <- function(rawMatrix) {
    log2Matrix <- log2(rawMatrix)
    normMatrix <- limma::normalizeCyclicLoess(log2Matrix, method="fast")
    colnames(normMatrix) <- colnames(rawMatrix)
    normMatrix
}
```

We are ready to perform the normalization.

```{r}
rtNormMat <- getRTNormalizedMatrix(dataMat, retentionTimes, performCyclicLoessNormalization, stepSizeMinutes=1, windowMinCount=100)
```

Let's double check the results. We expect a matrix in the same format and shape as before. Furthermore, we expect similar but not the exact same values as if we'd applied the normalization globally.

```{r}
globalNormMat <- performCyclicLoessNormalization(dataMat)
dim(rtNormMat)
dim(globalNormMat)
head(rtNormMat, 1)
head(globalNormMat, 1)
```

## Performing layered normalization

We have everything set up to perform the layered normalization. The result here is expected to be overall similar to the normal retention time approach.

```{r}
layeredRtNormMat <- getSmoothedRTNormalizedMatrix(dataMat, retentionTimes, performCyclicLoessNormalization, stepSizeMinutes=1, windowMinCount=100, frameShifts=3, mergeMethod="mean")

dim(layeredRtNormMat)
head(layeredRtNormMat, 1)
```

## Defining a wrapper

# Stepwise processing

NormalyzerDE consists of a set of steps. You can influence the order of this processing using options (X and X), but they can also be called directly from R.

## Step 1: Loading data

This step performs input validation of the data, and generates an object of the class NormalyzerDataset.

```{r}
jobName <- "vignette_run"
normObj <- getVerifiedNormalyzerObject("data.tsv", jobName, "design.tsv")
```

## Step 2: Generate normalizations

Here, normalizations are performed. This generates a NormalyzerResults object containing both a reference to its original dataset object, but also generated normalization matrices.

```{r}
normResults <- normMethods(normObj)
```

## Step 3: Generate performance measures

Performance measures are calculated for normalizations. These are stored in an object NormalizationEvaluationResults. A NormalyzerResults object similar to the one sent in is returned, but with this field added.

```{r}
normResultsWithEval <- analyzeNormalizations(normResults)
```

## Step 4: Output matrices to file

Generated normalization matrices are written to the provided folder.

```{r}
jobDir <- setupJobDir("vignette_run", ".")
writeNormalizedDatasets(normResultsWithEval, jobDir)
```

## Step 5: Generate evaluation plots

Performance measures are used to generate evaluation figures which is written in an evaluation report.

```{r}
generatePlots(normResultsWithEval, jobDir)
```

After this evaluation of normalizations and progression to statistics follows as described previously in this report.
