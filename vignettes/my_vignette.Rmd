    When working with omics data you will encounter technical biases. These can often in part be remedied by using appropriate normalization approach. Normalyzer helps this process by both performing a number of readibly available normalizations as well as generating a summary document of the results.

## Input format

NormalyzerDE expects a raw data file in the following format:

```
Example of format
```

Furthermore, it expects a design matrix:

```
Example of design matrix
```

The data matrix can be replaced with the output matrix from Proteios or peptide or protein (names?) output from MaxQuant.

Finally, it is possible to process using the format used in Normalyzer. There, no design matrix was used and sample groups were instead specified by adding an extra row at the top of the matrix.

Example of old format
```

## Processing

```{r}
head(readLines("design.tsv"))
```

```{r}
head(readLines("data.tsv"))
```

```{r}
library(NormalyzerDE)
normalyzer("data.tsv", "vignette_run", designMatrix="design.tsv", outputDir="testout")
```

### Detecting outliers

The total intensity barplot can be used to see whether any samples has unusually high or low total intensity.

![Total intensity](figs/1_tot_intensity.png)

The total missing can show if any sample has an unusual number of missing values, which can indicate an outlier.

![Total NA](figs/2_tot_na.png)

The MDS plot gives an indication of how samples seems to group overall. We expect replicates to cluster closely - in particular for technical replicates. If one or a few samples are far of here it might indicate outliers.

### Variance investigations

After normalization intragroup variance is expected to be reduced within the group. This gives an assessment of how much the different normalizations influence the data, and sometimes which seems to perform the strongest.

![Intragroup variance](figs/4_variance.png)

Normalization usually reduces variance measures compared to when doing a simple log2 transform. Similarly to the previous plot this gives an indication of how normalization influenced the variance in the data.

![Variance compared to log2](figs/5_comp_variance.png)

The stable variables plot looks into features identified as particularly stable and checks how different normalization approaches influence their intragroup and overall variance.

### Normalization comparisons

The scatter plot shows a distribution of CV over raw intensity for different normalization approaches (?).

![Scatter](figs/7_scatter.png)

The MA plots shows the fold between the two first samples retrieved from the data matrix. Often in non-normalized there is a fold shift between samples which can be countered by normalization. Ideally the red fitting-line will go close to zero here.

![MA plot](figs/8_ma.png)

The scatter plot plots intensities of sample 1 against sample 2. This gives a sense of how the intensities varies between samples. There will always be a variation, but overall they are expected to be close to a linear trend, with similar variation around independent of intensity.

## Parameters

# Retention time normalization

Retention time based normalization can be performed with an arbitrary normalization matrix.

## Basic usage

## Defining a wrapper

# Stepwise processing

NormalyzerDE consists of a set of steps. You can influence the order of this processing using options (X and X), but they can also be called directly from R.

## Step 1: Loading data

```{r}
normObj <- getVerifiedNormalyzerObject(...)
jobDir <- setupJobDir(...)
```

## Step 2: Generate normalizations

```{r}
normObj <- getVerifiedNormalyzerObject(...)
```

## Step 3: Generate performance measures

```{r}
normalyzerResultsObject <- normMethods(...)
```

## Step 4: Perform statistics

```{r}
```

## Step 5: Output matrices to file

```{r}
writeNormalizedDatasets(...)
```

## Step 6: Generate evaluation plots

```{r}
generatePlots(...)
```
